String Calculator in Kotlin

Mostly done to learn Kotlin, but also to see how close I could
get to the "immediate returns" variant of String Calculator
that I've settled on as my favorite C# solution: all methods
must start with `return`, so there can be no stored state in a
method, and the only boolean logic is terniary.
